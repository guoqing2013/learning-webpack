# Learn Webpack
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) helps you managing dependencies in your project, and also offers a friendly and fast development environment, simplifying a lot of common tasks behind a simple configuration file. 

It also allows you to bundle your modules into static assets for browsers. Its killer feature is the known as hot module replacement, which lets your live code in the browser update automatically as you change files in your preferred editor without a page reload.

Unfortunately, webpack doc pages are not friendly enough for beginners like me. That's why I decided to create this repository: to help people to learn webpack with a collection of exercises and examples.
